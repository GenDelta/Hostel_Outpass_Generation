# Hostel Outpass Portal

## Project Overview
The Hostel Outpass Portal aims to streamline and digitize the process of obtaining outpasses for students residing in college hostels. The current manual process involves physical forms, emails, and multiple approvals, leading to delays and inefficiencies. Our portal eliminates these challenges by creating a seamless online system that benefits students, administrative staff, and security personnel alike.

## Motivation
The existing system for outpasses is cumbersome, requiring students to manually fill out forms, obtain multiple approvals, and manage physical documents. This process is time-consuming and often frustrating for students. By transforming this process into an online portal, we simplify outpass requests, approvals, and monitoring, reducing stress and improving efficiency for all parties involved.

## Project Objective
Our objective is to digitize the outpass process, creating an efficient, user-friendly system for both students and campus staff. This portal will eliminate the need for physical documentation and provide a more structured and accountable process for managing student departures and returns.

## Features

### Student Section
- **Registration & Login**: Students can register and log in to the portal.
- **Outpass Request**: Students can initiate outpass requests by providing:
  - Name, email, contact number, and parent's contact information
  - Dates and timings for leave
  - Reason for absence
- **Edit & Delete Requests**: Students can update or cancel their outpass request before approval.

### Admin Section
- **Review Requests**: Admins can view, approve, or reject outpass requests submitted by students.
- **Request Management**: Admins have the authority to address any discrepancies, ensuring accurate records.

### Guard Section
- **Monitoring**: Registered guards can access approved outpasses to monitor student movements effectively.
- **Records**: Guards can keep records of students' departures and expected return times, enhancing campus security.
